    "description": "A group of Africans have left the Earth to create a colony on a distant planet. They respond with disquiet to the arrival of an uninvited guest. Let This Be A Warning was a response to the idea of 'black worlds', and how accessible they have always been to outsides parties both in fiction and reality. <br><br><b> Credits:</b> <a href='http://www.jimchuchu.com/'>Jim Chuchu</a> is a visual artist, filmmaker and musician from Nairobi, Kenya.

        "description": "The Black Techies is an interactive photography and interview project that focuses exclusively on black people in tech, in all their varied identities, but also as a specifically underrepresented group in technical roles within the industry. It presents an opportunity for a variety of conversations - on one side, the importance of representation, that you ‘Can’t be what you can’t see’ whilst on the flip side, black techies who might be isolated in their places of work, or their careers can see others like themselves. The Black Techies Project was inspired by Helena Price's <a href='http://www.techiesproject.com/'>Techies Project</a>. <br><br> <b>Credits:</b> The project was commissioned by Afrotech Fest and delivered by <a href='https://twitter.com/HeyLeeReed'>Hayley Reid</a>, a film-maker and oral historian, and <a href='http://roxene-anderson.com/'>Roxene Anderson</a>, a photographer."
