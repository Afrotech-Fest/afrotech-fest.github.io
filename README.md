# Afrotech Fest website


## Overview

This site has been created using Hugo, a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go.
It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data.

**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation][].**

## Deployment

**This site is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/).**

Deploying a new site with Netlify is so simple it fits in a tweet:

```
npm install netlify-cli -g <br>
cd ~/my-static-website <br>
netlify deploy <br>
```

This is all you need to deploy a static site folder, but Netlify can do much more for you.
