    <h1>ABOUT AFROTECH FEST</h1>
    <p>The festival is a response to the underrepresentation of black people in the technology industry – especially those who are marginalised in additional ways – as well as tech conferences and festivals being too expensive for many to attend. We want to create a festival that is intentionally diverse and inclusive of those often excluded.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>General programme</h4>
    <p>The two-day programme will cover talks, panel discussions, workshops and hackathons. These events will cover a host of themes including digital activism and campaigning, community, disability and tech, privacy and security, self-care/mental health in tech, education and public health.</p>
