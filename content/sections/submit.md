<h2>SUBMIT A PROPOSAL</h2>

<p>We're casting the net far and wide to find some of the most interesting, diverse and forward-thinking people in our community. We are very keen to hear from techies, makers, digital artists, tech enthusiasts and community workers whose aims resonate with ours. If you have an idea for a workshop or a talk, a suggestion about who or what else should be included, or even a topic that you feel should be addressed, then get in touch using the form below.</p>


<h3>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h3>

<p>Submissions are open to any one in or interested in tech regardless of background or area of expertise. As a guide, we've included some suggested themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital activism and campaigning</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Disability and tech</li>
<li>Data privacy and security</li>
<li>Self-care/mental health in tech</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Public health</li>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>AI and machine learning</li>

</ul>

<p>We plan on using the following to select proposals:</p>

<li>We would love to receive original and creative talks or workshops that touch on some of our festival themes.</li>
<li>We are particularly interested in receiving submissions from first-time speakers or workshoppers.</li>
<li>Workshops and talks will be considered separately. So you can submit a proposal for either or both.</li>
