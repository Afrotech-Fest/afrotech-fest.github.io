## SUBMIT A PROPOSAL

We're casting the net far and wide to find some of the most interesting, diverse and forward-thinking people in our community. We are very keen to hear from techies, artists, enthusiasts and community workers whose aims resonate with ours. If you have an idea for a workshop or a talk, a suggestion about who or what else should be included, or even a topic that you feel should be addressed, then fill out our [proposal form](www.example.com) or get in touch below!
