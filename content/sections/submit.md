<h2>SUBMIT A PROPOSAL</h2>

<p>We're casting the net far and wide to find some of the most interesting, diverse and forward-thinking people in our community. We are very keen to hear from techies, artists, enthusiasts and community workers whose aims resonate with ours. If you have an idea for a workshop or a talk, a suggestion about who or what else should be included, or even a topic that you feel should be addressed, then fill out our <a>[proposal form]</a> or get in touch below!</p>

<p>All festival attendees and participants (speakers, workshop facilitators and volunteers) are encouraged to read our <a href="/coc.html">code of conduct</a> and <a>accessibility</a> information.</p>

<p>[Add some information on submission deadlines.]</p>
