## THE TEAM

Three members of the organising team already organise events focusing on black communities in the UK, with a focus on this community and their relationships with science and technology. Afrotech Fest seeks to bring together these strands, specifically serving black people and creating conversations and connections beyond ‘networking’ or bending to fit into the current industries and climate.
