<h2>WHO IS IT FOR?</h2>

<p>Afrotech Fest is a place for black African and Caribbean people interested in technology. We take our motto “Join us and find your people,” to heart. We’re excited about the exceptional work that can come from black people coming together, particularly those who are non-conforming and are often excluded. As a result, we are actively engaged in connecting black people from all walks of life, so that we can build a technological future that is for us.</p>


<p>We look forward to welcoming you, whatever your age, gender, class or ability. Whether you’ve never written a line of code or regularly contribute to a huge project, Afrotech Fest is for you. </p>
