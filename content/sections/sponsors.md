## SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS

We would love you to get involved if you are interested in inspiring young people to develop an interest in making things and problem-solving, or in helping create a space to address issues of access in tech industries for black peoples of all ages and abilities in the UK. Supporting our work is a great way to show your commitment to marginalised communities, and for you to access a wealth of talent.
