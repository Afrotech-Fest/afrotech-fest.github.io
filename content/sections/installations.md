<h2>INSTALLATIONS</h2>

<p>Our installations explore the impact and presence of black people in the tech space. From an exploratory VR film that examines the idea of 'black worlds' and accessible space, to an immersive coding and braiding session that ties algorithmic patterns to the steady rhythm of plaiting hair.</p>

<p>We can't wait for our attendees to interact with our digital and digitally-inspired art installations.</p>
