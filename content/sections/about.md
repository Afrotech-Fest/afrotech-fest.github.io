<h2> ABOUT THE FESTIVAL</h2>

<p>Afrotech Fest is a two-day tech and digital festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage. The festival won’t replicate models for tech events, festivals and conferences that currently exist. It will instead explore where technology meets the arts, history, news, activism and representation. Afrotech Fest provides a space where people across a variety of backgrounds can imagine a future that’s free of the problems of the present.</p>

<p>The festival is a response to the underrepresentation of black people in the technology industry – especially those who are marginalised in additional ways – as well as tech conferences and festivals being too expensive for many to attend. We want to create a festival that is intentionally diverse and inclusive of those often excluded.</p>

<h3> WHAT TO EXPECT </h3>

<h4>General programme</h4>
<p>The two-day programme will cover talks, panel discussions, workshops and hackathons. These events will cover a host of themes including digital activism and campaigning, community, disability and tech, privacy and security, self-care/mental health in tech, education and public health.</p>

<h4>Youth programme</h4>

<p>Our youth track allows young black techies to travel in many lanes. It includes a tech fair, making stations, coding sessions and dozens of free kits from our supporters Makey Makey and Micro:bit.</p>

<h4>Digital installations</h4>
<p>The installations will be a collection of physical prototypes, photography, film and sound that aims to promote the visibility of black people in tech.</p>
