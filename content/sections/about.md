<h2> ABOUT THE FESTIVAL</h2>

<p>Afrotech Fest is a two-day tech and digital festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage. The festival won’t replicate models for tech events, festivals and conferences that currently exist. It will instead explore where technology meets the arts, history, news, activism and representation. Afrotech Fest provides a space where people across a variety of backgrounds can imagine a future that’s free of the problems of the present.</p>

<p>The festival is a response to the underrepresentation of black people in the technology industry – especially those who are marginalised in additional ways – as well technology conferences being too expensive for many to attend. We want to create a tech festival that is intentionally diverse and inclusive of those often excluded.</p>
