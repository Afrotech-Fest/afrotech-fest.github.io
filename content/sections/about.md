## ABOUT THE FESTIVAL

Afrotech Fest is a two-day tech and digital festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage. The&nbsp;festival won’t replicate models for tech events, festivals and conferences that currently exist. It will instead explore where technology meets the arts, history, news, activism and representation. Afrotech Fest provides a space where people across a variety of backgrounds can imagine a future that’s free of the problems of the&nbsp;present.  
 
The festival is a response to the underrepresentation of black people in the technology industry – especially those who are marginalised in additional ways – as well technology conferences being too expensive for many to attend. We want to create a tech festival that is intentionally diverse and inclusive of those often excluded.
