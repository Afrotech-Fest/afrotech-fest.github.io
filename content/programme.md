<h3>General Programme</h3>
<p>
    Our youth track empowers young black techies to travel in many lanes. It includes a tech fair
    and making stations, and well as workshops on coding, robotics. We’ll also have dozens of
    free kits from our supporters Makey Makey and Micro:bit. As we get closer to the festival,
    even more exciting elements will be announced!
