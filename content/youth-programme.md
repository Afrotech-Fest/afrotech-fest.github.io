<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2>

<p>On Saturday 27th, youâ€™ll find workshops on coding your own game, building your own robot and more. Our making stations will be packed with kits kindly donated by our supporters, so you can make your own portable speaker, weather sensor or produce an artwork with conductive paint. In addition to all of this we have our hackathon for 14+older youth where are presented with the challenge of the day and lastly, our tech fair, where young people from all over the UK are presenting their inventions for a chance to take some of our kits home.</p>
