<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2>

<p>On Saturday 27th, you’ll find workshops on coding your own game, building your own robot and more. Our making stations will be packed with kits kindly donated by our supporters, so you can make your own portable speaker, weather sensor or produce an artwork with conductive paint. In addition to all of this we will have a hackathon for young people aged 14+. Lastly, we'll have a tech fair, where young people from all over the UK will present their inventions for a chance to take some of our kits home.
