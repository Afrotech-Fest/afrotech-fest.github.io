 <h2 class="">ABOUT AFROTECH FEST</h2>
    
<p class="page-description">Hear and learn from some of the most interesting, diverse and forward-thinking people in our community.</p>

<h3>WHO IS IT FOR?</h3>

<p>We’re excited about the exceptional work that can come from black people coming together, particularly those who are non-conforming and are often excluded. As a result, we are actively engaged in connecting black people from all walks of life, so that we can build a technological future that is for us.</p>


<p>We look forward to welcoming you, whatever your age, gender, class or ability. Whether you’ve never written a line of code or regularly contribute to a huge project, Afrotech Fest is for you. </p>
