## PRESS KIT

#### Festival information
Afrotech Fest is a two-day tech festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage. Our inaugural festival takes place on the 26th - 27th of January, 2018 at Rich Mix London. Afrotech Fest is a not-for-profit event and is open to anyone to attend.

Afrotech Fest is not affliated with Blavity's Afrotech or with any other festival in the UK or across the world.


#### The organisers
Afrotech Fest is co-organised by a group of individuals who work inside and outside the tech industry as developers, creative technologists, designers, digital activists and fundraisers. We believe that tech festivals should be open, inclusive and affordable to as many people as possible, especially to those from a minority background who may not be able to afford the high-cost of most tech conferences and festivals.


#### Funding
Afrotech Fest is supported through the generous sponsorship of companies and organisations who believe in the aims and goals of the festival. The festival is not owned or controlled by a company.
